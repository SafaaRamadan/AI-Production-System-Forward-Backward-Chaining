# AI-Production-System-Forward-Backward-Chaining
This project is a simple AI **Production System** built using Python and Streamlit. It supports both **Forward Chaining** and **Backward Chaining** inference algorithms. The system reads rules and facts from uploaded text files and displays inferred knowledge with a user-friendly interface.

Features
-  Upload `rules.txt` and `facts.txt` via web interface
-  Run **Forward Chaining** to infer new facts
-  Run **Backward Chaining** to test if a goal can be reached
-  View facts at each reasoning cycle (step-by-step tracing)
-  Input a custom goal for both algorithms
-  Streamlit-powered clean UI for easy interaction
